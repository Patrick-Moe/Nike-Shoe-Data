# This is the first public project that I have done
This takes in an old 2017 report from Nike about shoe prices and ratings.
I applied statistical analysis to the data set to determine whether or not mens shoes had a significant difference in price to women's shoes.
I was unable to reject the null; and there is no statistical difference in shoe price
